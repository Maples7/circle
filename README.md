# Circle
A simple and elegant social network.

## What's this
This is an open source API server for a simple and elegant social network, whoes name is _circle_ for now.

I know there are lots of social networks in the world, but this one would be total different. 

The existing social networks, such as WeChat, Weibo, Twitter, Facebook etc, set no or few restricts for users. Although in WeChat, we can not access any user on the platform, but as time goes by, we would get many unfamiliar contacts, pretty hard to maintain.

According to a discovry of scientists, every one can only maintain his effective relationship with at most 150 people at the same time, so we hope every one can save some truely precious friends in his social network app and have real fun with sincere people.

What's more, we think every one should have private room on the Internet with only he can access. Every one have the motivation to record his life.

This is _circle_, and this is designed for pure Internet people.
